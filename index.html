          <h3>ASK YOURSELF TWO QUESTIONS:</h3>
          <p>1. Why don't you use your back yard as much as you like?</p>
          <p>2. How much money have you invested in your back yard, only to see it go unused? </p>
          <p>Chances are, you've spent thousands of dollars on your yard -- and maybe then some!</p>
          <p>And, to make matters worse, you probably don’t get the return on that investment because</p>
          <p>mosquitoes, flies, and other insects keep you from enjoying it. Until now.</p>
          <h3>TAKE YOUR YARD BACK!</h3>
          <p>If you’re tired of fighting off insects with messy spray can repellents, noisy bug zappers and </p>
          <p>smelly foggers: The Mosquito Fence is for you!</p>
          <p>The <strong>Mosquito Fence</strong> is an automatic insect control system that makes your yard a safe </p>
          <p>haven from mosquitoes, flies, wasps, spiders, and dozens of other insects. And it doesn’t </p>
          <p>just repel them — it kills them so they can never come back!</p>
          <p>It is safe, convenient and easy to use, making it easier than ever to enjoy your yard. And it </p>
          <p>maximizes back yard investments like pools, hot tubs, decks &amp; patios, gardens, swing sets, </p>
          <p>porches and more. Isn’t it time to take your yard back?</p>
          <p>Let United Mosquito &amp; Fly Control design a custom, fully-automatic solution for your yard so </p>
          <p>you can take your yard back! Call us today at <a href="tel: +19135583814">913-558-3814</a>!</p>
          <h3>IMPROVE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND YOUR OUTDOOR ENJOYMENT!</h3>
          <p>The <strong>Mosquito Fence</strong> not only helps you reclaim your yard, it improves health conditions by </p>
          <p>eliminating disease carrying insects. Biting insects spread diseases like Heartworms and </p>
          <p>the West Nile Virus to you and your pets — and even your children. Insects can also cause </p>
          <p>allergic reactions. The solution is simple: the <strong>Mosquito Fence</strong> .</p>
          <p>Only the Mosquito Fence creates a barrier around a custom-designed perimeter — a </p>
          <p>barrier that stops would-be insect invaders, keeping your family healthier and more </p>
          <p>comfortable. And the Mosquito Fence uses an EPA-approved insecticide — so you can rest </p>
          <p>Below is an example of how a system is designed for a residential appliation:</p>
          <p>easy, knowing the Mosquito Fence is protecting your yard.</p>
